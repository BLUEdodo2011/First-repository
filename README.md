# First-repository

   This is my first repository.It's basically a test to see how my new account works and to explore Git HUB. I have a good joke:
   It was the final exam of the year. There were 3 students. A genius, a good one and a stupid one one. The genius enters first. After he leaves, he says that it was like from teacher to teacher. Enters the smart one. After he leaves, he says that it was like from a teacher to a student. Enters the fool. After he comes out, he says that it was like from priest to priest. The others ask him what he wants to say. He says that when the teacher asked him a question, he crossed himself and when he answered, the teacher also crossed himself.
